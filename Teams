Hi Sowmiya,

I’ve been giving my full effort and dedication to all my tasks completing them on time and staying active throughout the training. However, I noticed that my overall average rating is lower compared to others, which made me a bit concerned.

I kindly request you to recheck my rating once, just in case there was any mistake while updating it. Also, please make sure it’s unbiased as I truly believe you’re a fair and good trainer. If there are any specific areas where I need to improve, I’d really appreciate your honest feedback. I’m someone who genuinely wants to grow and do better each day.

Regards,
Prasoona
